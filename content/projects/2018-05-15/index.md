# Resume

GoodsID is a company that want to bring the block chain to the luxury and art industry. Helping customers to trace each good supply chain it provides a way to limit counterfeiting and improve good value.

I've been working with a team of 5 with an AWS Elastic Beanstalk hosting, an Elixir/Phoenix back-end API for multiple Angular clients.

Iâ€™ve architected and deployed the cloud infrastructure, emailing system and RabbitMQ queuing system for asynchronous treatments.

I've extensively used AES and RSA cryptography for data anonymization and integrity. The API that I made provided an account management system based on JWT tokens, a media management through AWS S3 and a NodeJS interface to interact with IOTA.

Stack : AWS Elastic Beanstalk, S3, Cloud Front, RabbitMQ, Docker, Elixir/Phoenix, PostgreSQL, Angular, IOTA.
