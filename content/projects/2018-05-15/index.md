GoodsID is a company that want to bring the blockchain to the luxury and art industry. Helping customers to trace each good supply chain it provides a way to limit counterfeiting and improve good value.

I've been working with a team of 5 with an AWS ElasticBeanstalk hosting, an Elixir/Phoenix back-end API for multiple Angular 6 clients.

I've extensively used AES and RSA cryptography for data anonymization and integrity. The API that I made provided an account management system based on JWT tokens, a media management through AWS S3 and a NodeJS interface to interact with IOTA Blockchain.

Stack : AWS ElasticBeanstalk, S3, CloudFront, Docker, Elixir/Phoenix, PostgreSQL, Angular 6.
