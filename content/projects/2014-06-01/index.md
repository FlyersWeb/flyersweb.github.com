# Resume

S4M is a digital advertising company focused on mobile devices. We managed internally three projects, one to manage advertising campaigns, one for mobile application reputation on stores and another for KPI analytic.

In the back end 5 team members, I implemented new features to the PHP/Symfony2 back end connected to a MariaDB. For example, I've made a generic interface for analytic communication with third parties like Google Ad Words or Facebook.

I've also worked on the MRC accreditation compliance with data anonymization work and fraud detection. For this we used a Redis database to do time series spam detection.

Stack : Varnish, Nginx, MariaDB, PHP/Symfony2, AngularJS, JavaScript.
