# Resume

S4M is a digital advertising company focused on mobile devices. We managed internally three projects, one to manage advertising campaigns, one for mobile application reputation on stores and another for KPI analytics.

In the back end 5 team members, I implemented new features to the PHP/Symfony2 back end connected to a MariaDB. For example, I've made a generic interface for analytics communication with third parties like Google AdWords or Facebook. I've also worked on the MRC accreditation compliance with data anonymization work and fraud detection. For this we used a Redis database to do time series spam detection.

I also worked on the front end migration to AngularJS and on new widgets creation.
