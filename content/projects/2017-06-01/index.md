# Resume

OuiCar is a company that allows customers to rent their own car. They so can register their car in the system and, on the other side, customers can search and book the car they want.

I've first been working with the front end team of 5 on implementing the new API on a React / Redux-saga plugged to a GraphQL isomorphic stack for a couple of weeks.

Then I mainly worked with the back end team of 5 on the Elastic search based search engine providing an API done in NodeJS with Koa. The engine integrated a car catalog search. By combining geocoding and renters reviews we applied a relevance scoring.

I've also worked on the Symfony 3 car catalog engine backed by a MySQL database hosted on AWS RDS.
All our processes were following the scrum agile methodology.

Stack : AWS SNS/SQS, RDS, Elastic Cache, Elastic Search, Docker, PHP/Symfony3, MySQL, React/Redux-saga.
