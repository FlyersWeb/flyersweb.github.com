# Resume

Club Méditerranée is an all inclusive hotel accommodation company. I've worked there as part of the front end shopping 5 members team being part of the full 20 front end team.

We've migrated all international websites, from USA to China, to the new version based on React.

Then I've been working on SEO improvements, customer reassurance and on the custom content migration system to allow every country business unit to customize their website.

I've worked on the search engine by making the GraphQL API interface and integrating it to the project. I'm proud to have added Redux to the project to ease component communication while working on this.

On the infrastructure side, I've worked on Heroku review applications deployment for feature validation by the business units.

Stack : Heroku, GraphQL, NodeJS, React/Redux.
