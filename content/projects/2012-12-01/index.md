# Resume

Dresden Partners is an IT Consulting company based in Mexico city and San Francisco. I've worked on different projects, for US and Mexican companies, first as a developer, then as a project manager.

I've worked with a team of 2 designers, 3 mobile developers and 2 web developers.

As an example I've worked on the Eweclid education mobile application API with a MySQL database, a NodeJS back end and a BackboneJS based back office system. 

I've also worked on the Evamerc customer satisfaction analytic dashboard using a PHP/Symfony2 back end and some HighchartJS quirks.

Ultimately I've worked on an appliance to the ADOMovil project tender which resulted in us winning the market. ADO is the biggest customer transportation company of Mexico and I made all project projection and deliverable plan for the back end part.
